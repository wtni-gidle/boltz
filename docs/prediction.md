# Prediction

Once `boltz` is installed, you can run predictions with:

`boltz predict <INPUT_PATH> [OPTIONS]`

* `<INPUT_PATH>` can be either a single .yaml or .fasta file (YAML is preferred; FASTA is deprecated), or a directory, in which case predictions will be run on all `.yaml` and `.fasta` files inside.
* If you include `--use_msa_server`, the MSA will be generated automatically via the mmseqs2 server. Without this flag, you must provide a pre-computed MSA.
* If you include `--use_potentials`, Boltz will apply inference-time potentials to improve the physical plausibility of the predicted poses.
* By default, Boltz runs structure and affinity prediction even if matching output files already exist. Add `--skip` to skip a seed only when all required model, summary confidence, and pLDDT files are present. The check does not validate the MSA, templates, constraints, checkpoint, or inference parameters, so use a separate output directory for different experimental conditions.
* The optional top-level YAML `name` defines the target/record ID, job directory, generated `_data.yaml` filename, and MSA prefix. If omitted, the input filename stem is used for backward compatibility. A name must be a non-empty, single filename component.
* `-D true -P false` runs only the MSA data pipeline and writes `<out_dir>/<name>/<name>_data.yaml` plus separate paired/unpaired A3M files. `-D false -P true` accepts that generated YAML directly, creates the native keyed CSV at runtime, and runs preprocessing and inference. At least one stage must be enabled.
* `--seeds 42` runs one seed, while `--seeds 40,41,42` runs several seeds sequentially in one process while sharing preprocessing and checkpoint loading. When omitted, one concrete seed is generated and printed.


## Input format

Boltz takes inputs in `.yaml` format, which specifies the components of the complex.  
Below is the full schema (each section is described in detail afterward):

```yaml
name: TARGET_NAME
sequences:
    - ENTITY_TYPE:
        id: CHAIN_ID 
        sequence: SEQUENCE      # only for protein, dna, rna
        smiles: 'SMILES'        # only for ligand, exclusive with ccd
        ccd: CCD                # only for ligand, exclusive with smiles
        msa: MSA_PATH           # only for protein
        modifications:
          - position: RES_IDX   # index of residue, starting from 1
            ccd: CCD            # CCD code of the modified residue
        cyclic: false
    - ENTITY_TYPE:
        id: [CHAIN_ID, CHAIN_ID]    # multiple ids in case of multiple identical entities
        ...
constraints:
    - bond:
        atom1: [CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX, ATOM_NAME]
        atom2: [CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX, ATOM_NAME]
    - pocket:
        binder: CHAIN_ID
        contacts: [[CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX/ATOM_NAME], [CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX/ATOM_NAME]]
        max_distance: DIST_ANGSTROM
        force: false # if force is set to true (default is false), a potential will be used to enforce the pocket constraint
    - contact:
        token1: [CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX/ATOM_NAME]
        token2: [CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX/ATOM_NAME]
        max_distance: DIST_ANGSTROM
        force: false # if force is set to true (default is false), a potential will be used to enforce the contact constraint

templates:
    - cif: CIF_PATH  # if only a path is provided, Boltz will find the best matchings
      force: true # optional, if force is set to true (default is false), a potential will be used to enforce the template
      threshold: DISTANCE_THRESHOLD # optional, controls the distance (in Angstroms) that the prediction can deviate from the template
    - cif: CIF_PATH
      chain_id: CHAIN_ID   # optional, specify which chain to find a template for
    - cif: CIF_PATH
      chain_id: [CHAIN_ID, CHAIN_ID]  # can be more than one
      template_id: [TEMPLATE_CHAIN_ID, TEMPLATE_CHAIN_ID]
    - pdb: PDB_PATH # if a pdb path is provided, Boltz will incrementally assign template chain ids based on the chain names in the PDB file (A1, A2, B1, etc)
      chain_id: [CHAIN_ID, CHAIN_ID]
      template_id: [TEMPLATE_CHAIN_ID, TEMPLATE_CHAIN_ID]
properties:
    - affinity:
        binder: CHAIN_ID

```

### Sequences and molecules

The sequences section has one entry per unique chain or molecule.
* Polymers: use `ENTITY_TYPE` equals to `protein`, `dna`, or `rna`, and provide a `sequence`.
* Ligands (non-polymers): use `ENTITY_TYPE` equals `ligand`, and provide either a `smiles` string or a `ccd` code (but not both).
* `CHAIN_ID`: unique identifier for each chain/molecule. If multiple identical entities exist, set id as a list (e.g. `[A, B]`).

For proteins:
* By default, an `msa` must be provided.
* If `--use_msa_server` is set, the MSA is auto-generated (so `msa` can be omitted).
* To use a precomputed custom MSA, set `msa: MSA_PATH` pointing to a `.a3m` file. If you have more than one protein chain, use a CSV format instead of a3m with two columns: `sequence` (protein sequence) and `key` (a unique identifier for matching rows across chains). Sequences with the same key are mutually aligned.
* To force single-sequence mode (not recommended, as it reduces accuracy), set `msa: empty`.
* A generated `*_data.yaml` represents an automatically searched MSA as `msa: {paired: PATH, unpaired: PATH}`. This mapping is a wrapper extension intended as the data-pipeline/inference hand-off. The normal scalar `msa: PATH` form remains supported.
* Prepared A3M paths may contain plain text, gzip, xz, or zstd data. Compression is detected from magic bytes rather than the filename, so both a real compressed `.a3m.zst` and a plain-text file carrying that suffix are handled correctly.

The `modifications` field is optional and allows specification of modified residues in polymers (`protein`, `dna`, or `rna`).  
- `position`: index of the residue (starting from 1)  
- `ccd`: CCD code of the modified residue (currently supported only for CCD ligands)  

The `cyclic` flag indicates whether a polymer chain (not ligands) is cyclic.

### Constraints

`constraints` is an optional field that allows you to specify additional information about the input structure. 


* The `bond` constraint specifies covalent bonds between two atoms (`atom1` and `atom2`). It is currently only supported for CCD ligands and canonical residues, `CHAIN_ID` refers to the id of the residue set above, `RES_IDX` is the index (starting from 1) of the residue (1 for ligands), and `ATOM_NAME` is the standardized atom name (can be verified in CIF file of that component on the RCSB website).

* The `pocket` constraint specifies the residues associated with binding interaction, where `binder` refers to the chain binding to the pocket (which can be a molecule, protein, DNA or RNA) and `contacts` is the list of chain and residue indices (starting from 1, or atom names if the chain is a molecule) that form the binding site for the `binder`. `max_distance` specifies the maximum distance (in Angstrom, supported between 4A and 20A with 6A as default) between any atom in the `binder` and any atom in each of the `contacts` elements. If `force` is set to true, a potential will be used to enforce the pocket constraint.

* The `contact` constraint specifies a contact between two residues or atoms, where `token1` and `token2` are the identifiers of the residues or atoms (in the format `[CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX/ATOM_NAME]`). `max_distance` specifies the maximum distance (in Angstrom, supported between 4A and 20A with 6A as default) between any pair of atoms in the two elements. If `force` is set to true, a potential will be used to enforce the contact constraint. 

### Templates
`templates` is optional and allows specification of structural templates for protein chains. At minimum, provide the path to a CIF or PDB file.

If you wish to explicitly define which of the chains in your YAML should be templated using this file, you can use the `chain_id` entry to specify them. If providing a PDB file, chain ids will be incrementally assigned to each subchain in a parent PDB chain resulting in template chain ids of A1, A2, B1, etc for PDB chains A and B. Make sure to look at the structure of the template PDB file to determine the corresponding value of `template_id` to provide. Whether a set of ids is provided or not, Boltz will find the best matching chains from the provided template. If you wish to explicitly define the mapping yourself, you may provide the corresponding `template_id`. 

For any template you provide, you can also specify a `force` flag which will use a potential to enforce that the backbone does not deviate excessively from the template during the prediction. When using `force` one must specify also the `threshold` field which controls the distance (in Angstroms) that the prediction can deviate from the template. 

### Properties (affinity)
`properties` is an optional field that allows you to specify whether you want to compute the affinity. If enabled, you must also provide the chain_id corresponding to the small molecule against which the affinity will be computed. Only one single small molecule can be specified for affinity computation. It must be a ligand chain (not a protein, DNA or RNA) and has to be at most 128 atoms counting heavy atoms and hydrogens kept by `RDKit RemoveHs`, however, we do not recommend running the affinity module with ligands significantly larger than 56 atoms (counted as above, limit set during training). At this point, Boltz only supports the computation of affinity of small molecules to protein targets, if ran with an RNA/DNA/co-factor target, the code will not crash but the output will be unreliable.

## Options

The following options are available for the `predict` command:

    boltz predict input_path [OPTIONS]

Examples of common options include:

* Adding `--use_msa_server` flag, Boltz auto-generates the MSA using the mmseqs2 server. 

* Adding the `--use_potentials` flag, Boltz uses an inference time potential that significantly improve the physical quality of the poses. 

* To predict a structure using 10 recycling steps and 25 samples (the default parameters for AlphaFold3) use (note however that the prediction will take significantly longer): `--recycling_steps 10 --diffusion_samples 25`

## Output

For `target.yaml` and `--out_dir results`, job artifacts are organized below `results/target/`. A generated `target_data.yaml` maps back to the same target by removing the `_data` filename suffix.

After a data-only run followed by inference-only, the persistent layout is:

```
results/
└── target/
    ├── target_data.yaml
    ├── msa/
    │   ├── target_0_paired.a3m
    │   └── target_0_unpaired.a3m
    └── predictions/
        ├── models/seed-[seed]_sample-0_model.cif
        ├── summary_confidences/seed-[seed]_sample-0_summary_confidences.json
        ├── full_data/plddt_seed-[seed]_sample-0.npz
        ├── full_data/pae_seed-[seed]_sample-0.npz
        ├── full_data/pde_seed-[seed]_sample-0.npz
        ├── embeddings/seed-[seed]_embeddings.npz
        └── affinity/seed-[seed]_affinity.json
```

Inference-only creates the keyed CSV, `processed/` data, manifest, and Lightning working files in a process-private temporary directory and removes them after prediction. It therefore does **not** persist `target_0.csv`, `processed/`, or `lightning_logs/` below `results/target/`. A combined `-D true -P true` run retains the native persistent preprocessing behavior and may include those paths.

For the normal one-target job, prediction categories are written directly below `predictions/`. Legacy multi-record invocations retain a `<record.id>/` subdirectory to prevent filename collisions. Samples retain their original diffusion sample index; they are not renamed by confidence rank. Confidence scores remain available in the summary JSON. With `--seeds`, every seed uses the same layout and filename pattern; requested seeds are run sequentially, and `--skip` evaluates completeness independently for each seed.

Each output folder includes a confidence `.json` file with aggregated confidence scores for that sample. Its structure is:
```yaml
{
    "confidence_score": 0.8367,       # Aggregated score used to sort the predictions, corresponds to 0.8 * complex_plddt + 0.2 * iptm (ptm for single chains)
    "ptm": 0.8425,                    # Predicted TM score for the complex
    "iptm": 0.8225,                   # Predicted TM score when aggregating at the interfaces
    "ligand_iptm": 0.0,               # ipTM but only aggregating at protein-ligand interfaces
    "protein_iptm": 0.8225,           # ipTM but only aggregating at protein-protein interfaces
    "complex_plddt": 0.8402,          # Average pLDDT score for the complex
    "complex_iplddt": 0.8241,         # Average pLDDT score when upweighting interface tokens
    "complex_pde": 0.8912,            # Average PDE score for the complex
    "complex_ipde": 5.1650,           # Average PDE score when aggregating at interfaces  
    "chains_ptm": {                   # Predicted TM score within each chain
        "0": 0.8533,
        "1": 0.8330
    },
    "pair_chains_iptm": {             # Predicted (interface) TM score between each pair of chains
        "0": {
            "0": 0.8533,
            "1": 0.8090
        },
        "1": {
            "0": 0.8225,
            "1": 0.8330
        }
    }
}
```
`confidence_score`, `ptm` and `plddt` scores (and their interface and individual chain analogues) have a range of [0, 1], where higher values indicate higher confidence. `pde` scores have a unit of angstroms, where lower values indicate higher confidence.

The output affinity `.json` file is organized as follows:
```yaml
{
    "affinity_pred_value": 0.8367,             # Predicted binding affinity from the ensemble model
    "affinity_probability_binary": 0.8425,     # Predicted binding likelihood from the ensemble model
    "affinity_pred_value1": 0.8225,            # Predicted binding affinity from the first model of the ensemble
    "affinity_probability_binary1": 0.0,       # Predicted binding likelihood from the first model in the ensemble
    "affinity_pred_value2": 0.8225,            # Predicted binding affinity from the second model of the ensemble
    "affinity_probability_binary2": 0.8402,    # Predicted binding likelihood from the second model in the ensemble
}
```

There are two main predictions in the affinity output: `affinity_pred_value` and `affinity_probability_binary`. They are trained on largely different datasets, with different supervisions, and should be used in different contexts. 

The `affinity_probability_binary` field should be used to detect binders from decoys, for example in a hit-discovery stage. It's value ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the predicted probability that the ligand is a binder.

The `affinity_pred_value` aims to measure the specific affinity of different binders and how this changes with small modifications of the molecule (*note that this implies that it should only be used when comparing different active molecules, not inactives*). This should be used in ligand optimization stages such as hit-to-lead and lead-optimization. It reports a binding affinity value as `log10(IC50)`, derived from an `IC50` measured in `μM`. Lower values indicate stronger predicted binding, for instance:
- IC50 of $10^{-9}$ M $\longrightarrow$ our model outputs $-3$ (strong binder)
- IC50 of $10^{-6}$ M $\longrightarrow$ our model outputs $0$ (moderate binder)
- IC50 of $10^{-4}$ M $\longrightarrow$ our model outputs $2$ (weak binder / decoy)

You can convert the model's output to pIC50 in `kcal/mol` by using `y --> (6 - y) * 1.364` where `y` is the model's prediction.


## Authentication to MSA Server

When using the `--use_msa_server` option with a server that requires authentication, you can provide credentials in one of two ways:

### 1. Basic Authentication

- Use the CLI options `--msa_server_username` and `--msa_server_password`.
- Or, set the environment variables:
  - `BOLTZ_MSA_USERNAME` (for the username)
  - `BOLTZ_MSA_PASSWORD` (for the password, recommended for security)

**Example:**
```bash
export BOLTZ_MSA_USERNAME=myuser
export BOLTZ_MSA_PASSWORD=mypassword
boltz predict ... --use_msa_server
```
Or:
```bash
boltz predict ... --use_msa_server --msa_server_username myuser --msa_server_password mypassword
```

### 2. API Key Authentication

- Use the CLI options `--api_key_header` (default: `X-API-Key`) and `--api_key_value` to specify the header and value for API key authentication.
- Or, set the API key value via the environment variable `MSA_API_KEY_VALUE` (recommended for security).

**Example using CLI:**
```bash
boltz predict ... --use_msa_server --api_key_header X-API-Key --api_key_value <your-api-key>
```

**Example using environment variable:**
```bash
export MSA_API_KEY_VALUE=<your-api-key>
boltz predict ... --use_msa_server --api_key_header X-API-Key
```
If both the CLI option and environment variable are set, the CLI option takes precedence.

> If your server expects a different header, set `--api_key_header` accordingly (e.g., `--api_key_header X-Gravitee-Api-Key`).

---

**Note:**  
Only one authentication method (basic or API key) can be used at a time. If both are provided, the program will raise an error.


## Fasta format (deprecated)

FASTA format is still supported but is deprecated and only supports a limited subset of features compared to YAML.

| Feature  | Fasta              | YAML    |
| -------- |--------------------| ------- |
| Polymers | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:   |
| Smiles   | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:   |
| CCD code | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:   |
| Custom MSA | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:   |
| Modified Residues | :x:                |  :white_check_mark: |
| Covalent bonds | :x:                | :white_check_mark:   |
| Pocket conditioning | :x:                | :white_check_mark:   |
| Affinity | :x:                | :white_check_mark:   |


It contain entries as follows:

```
>CHAIN_ID|ENTITY_TYPE|MSA_PATH
SEQUENCE
```

The `CHAIN_ID` is a unique identifier for each input chain. The `ENTITY_TYPE` can be one of `protein`, `dna`, `rna`, `smiles`, `ccd` (note that we support both smiles and CCD code for ligands). The `MSA_PATH` is only applicable to proteins. By default, MSA's are required, but they can be omited by passing the `--use_msa_server` flag which will auto-generate the MSA using the mmseqs2 server. If you wish to use a custom MSA, use it to set the path to the `.a3m` file containing a pre-computed MSA for this protein. If you wish to explicitly run single sequence mode (which is generally advised against as it will hurt model performance), you may do so by using the special keyword `empty` for that protein (ex: `>A|protein|empty`). For custom MSA, you may wish to indicate pairing keys to the model. You can do so by using a CSV format instead of a3m with two columns: `sequence` with the protein sequences and `key` which is a unique identifier indicating matching rows across CSV files of each protein chain.

For each of these cases, the corresponding `SEQUENCE` will contain an amino acid sequence (e.g. `EFKEAFSLF`), a sequence of nucleotide bases (e.g. `ATCG`), a smiles string (e.g. `CC1=CC=CC=C1`), or a CCD code (e.g. `ATP`), depending on the entity.

## Troubleshooting

 - When running on old NVIDIA GPUs, you may encounter an error related to the `cuequivariance` library. In this case, you should run the model with the `--no_kernels` flag, which will disable the use of the `cuequivariance` library and allow the model to run without it. This may result in slightly lower performance, but it will allow you to run the model on older hardware.
